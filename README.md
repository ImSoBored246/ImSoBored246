Hello! I’m @ImSoBored246. I also go by M200Chan, ImSoBored927 and kthered online. 
I’m very interested in game development, though I do quite enjoy programming other aspects too.
I’m currently learning C#, and trying to improve my general programming skills.
I’m not looking to collaborate on any projects at this time.
I can be contacted through email (imsobored246@outlook.com). If I don't respond, feel free to send a second email.
